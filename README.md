# RESTful-website-Java-SpringBoot-backend

## Project Overview 
The project involves creating a Single Page application using RESTFul archietecture. The application works as a Java SpringBoot app as a backend API that sends data in JSON format. The Java SpringBoot app connects to a MySQL database using Hibernate, an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. The application works as a Angular 5 app in the front end. The code for the front end can be found in the repository, [RESTful-website-Angular4-frontend](https://github.com/ameypophali/RESTful-website-Angular4-frontend).
